# TCMMBay Tensorflow Demos

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

This project demonstrates how to integrate AI models into Angular applications using TensorFlow.js and optimize performance with Web Workers. The goal is to showcase practical examples of developing cutting-edge web applications that run AI directly in the browser, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Key Features
- TensorFlow.js Integration: Run models directly in the browser.
- Web Worker Optimization: Perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, improving application performance.
- Practical Examples: Source code demonstrating how to combine Angular and TensorFlow.js to create modern AI applications.
- Interactive Demos: Examples illustrating the use of multiple AI models in parallel and performance management.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
